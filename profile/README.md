Our Story
STREYDA was founded in 2020 with a clear vision - to bring Czech and European companies top-tier technological solutions without unnecessary sales pressure and with a focus on clients' real needs.
Our team consists of senior developers and consultants with years of experience from enterprise environments. We specialize in ServiceNow, BMC Remedy, IBM Maximo platforms and custom development in modern frameworks.
Today we operate from Prague and Amsterdam and deliver projects for clients across Europe. Our goal is not to be the biggest, but the best at what we do.
